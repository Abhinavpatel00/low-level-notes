Fixed-length encoding, also known as fixed-width encoding, is a method of data compression where each element or symbol in the data is represented using a fixed number of bits. This means that regardless of the actual frequency or probability of occurrence of different symbols, they all occupy the same amount of space in the encoded data. Fixed-length encoding is a simple and straightforward compression technique but is not very efficient when dealing with data where symbols have varying frequencies.

In fixed-length encoding:

- Each symbol in the original data is assigned a unique binary code.
- All binary codes have the same length, meaning they use the same number of bits.
- The length of each code is determined in advance, typically based on the maximum number of symbols in the data.

Here's a simple diagram representing fixed-length encoding:

```
Original Data Symbol: A B C D E F G H
Symbol Codes:
A -> 000
B -> 001
C -> 010
D -> 011
E -> 100
F -> 101
G -> 110
H -> 111

Encoded Data: 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111
```

 above, each symbol (A to H) is assigned a fixed-length binary code of 3 bits. Regardless of the symbol's frequency or importance, it always uses 3 bits in the encoded data. This means that even if some symbols occur more frequently than others, they all occupy the same amount of space in the compressed data.

While fixed-length encoding is easy to implement and decode, it is not space-efficient for data with variable symbol frequencies. Other compression techniques, variable-length encoding (e.g., Huffman coding) ,dictionary-based methods (e.g., Lempel-Ziv-Welch), are more suitable for higher compression ratios.

Certainly, let's delve into a more advanced explanation of fixed-length encoding using a detailed diagram with Markdown:

In this diagram, we'll break down the process of fixed-length encoding step by step:

1. **Original Data (Input):** This is your initial data that you want to encode. In our example, we have three symbols: A, B, and C.

2. **Encoding (Mapping):** For fixed-length encoding, each symbol is assigned a unique fixed-length binary code. In this case, we've chosen 2 bits for each symbol. Symbol A is assigned '00,' Symbol B is assigned '01,' and Symbol C is assigned '10.' These assignments are predetermined and remain the same for every instance of encoding.

3. **Encoded Data (Output):** This section shows the result of encoding the original data. We replace each symbol with its corresponding binary code. So, if we encode "ABC," it becomes "00010010" in binary.

# Formula

**1. Number of Symbols (N):** This is the total number of unique symbols in the data that you want to encode. Each symbol corresponds to a specific character, digit, or entity in the data.

**2. Bit Length (L):** In fixed-length encoding, all symbols are represented using the same number of bits, and this number is determined based on the maximum number of symbols (N) you need to represent. The formula to calculate the bit length (L) is as follows:

   ```
   L = ceil(log2(N))
   ```

   - `log2(N)` calculates the base-2 logarithm of N, which represents how many bits are needed to represent N symbols.
   - `ceil()` rounds up the result to the nearest integer to ensure that you have enough bits to represent all symbols.

**3. Total Number of Bits (B):** This represents the total number of bits needed to encode a given amount of data (e.g., a sequence of symbols or a message). The formula to calculate the total number of bits (B) for encoding a specific message is as follows:

   ```
   B = L * M
   ```

   - `L` is the bit length determined by the number of symbols you need to represent.
   - `M` is the number of symbols in the message or data that you want to encode.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

Suppose you want to encode the following set of symbols: A, B, C, D, and E (N = 5).

1. Calculate the bit length (L):

   ```
   L = ceil(log2(5)) = ceil(2.322) = 3 bits
   ```

   You need 3 bits to represent each symbol.

2. Encode a sequence of symbols, for example, "ABCD":

   ```
   B = L * M = 3 bits/symbol * 4 symbols = 12 bits
   ```

   To represent the sequence "ABCD" using fixed-length encoding, you would need 12 bits in total.
